# PayProof progress log

## Phase 1: Skeleton and first deploy — in progress (Tue 6 / Wed 7 Oct)

### Done
- Repo structure: `README.md` stub, `.gitignore` extended (service-account JSON patterns, Python/OS junk), `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`.
- Verified before coding:
  - Firebase Hosting → Cloud Run rewrite **is** supported in `asia-south1` (current Firebase docs list it explicitly).
  - Vertex AI Gemini models `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.8-flash` are **not** available as regional endpoints in `asia-south1` — only `global`, `us` (multi-region), `eu` (multi-region). So `VERTEX_LOCATION` defaults to `global` in `.env.example`, not `asia-south1`. Cloud Run itself still runs in `asia-south1`.
- Backend skeleton: `backend/config.py` (reads all section 20 env vars), `backend/errors.py` (single `{error_code, message, detail?}` JSON error shape), `backend/auth.py` (Firebase ID token verification, user id only ever from the verified token), `backend/gemini_client.py` (one client module switching on `GEMINI_BACKEND`; no Gemini call made yet), `backend/main.py` (`GET /health`, `GET /api/whoami`).
- Tests: `tests/test_main.py` — `/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`; `/api/whoami` without a token returns 401 with `error_code: missing_token`. No network calls. `pytest -q` passes (2 passed).
- Security note: a live-looking `GEMINI_API_KEY` value briefly appeared in the tracked `.env.example` file (not `.env`) during this session. The owner removed it and was told to rotate/revoke that key in AI Studio. Verify this was done before any commit/push of `.env.example`.

### Decisions
- `requirements.txt` pinned to versions already present in the local environment (checked against PyPI latest, all current for Python 3.13): fastapi 0.141.1, uvicorn 0.53.0, pydantic 2.13.5, python-dotenv 1.2.4, firebase-admin 7.7.0, google-genai 2.28.0, python-multipart 0.0.32, httpx 0.28.1, pytest 9.1.1.
- `VERTEX_LOCATION=global` (see above) instead of `asia-south1`.

### Next
- Remaining Phase 1 items: frontend skeleton (`frontend/index.html` with anonymous sign-in + `/api/whoami` call, `frontend/firebase-config.js` placeholder), `firebase.json` (Hosting rewrite to Cloud Run `payproof` in `asia-south1`) and Firestore security rules, then exact PowerShell deploy commands (not run — needs owner approval).
- Owner still needs to: confirm Firebase Authentication (Anonymous + Google) is enabled in the console; create a billing budget alert before first deploy; note free-trial expiry date if applicable.

### Resume commands (PowerShell)
```powershell
cd C:\dev\payproof
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
